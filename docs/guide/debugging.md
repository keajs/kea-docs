## Devtools

Currently there are no kea-specific devtools available. However the Redux devtools work really
well. 

With them you can:

- See all dispatched actions
- See the payload of each action
- See how the store's state looked like after each action
- See the diff the action made in the store's state

Get them for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en)
or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reduxdevtools/)

:::tip Project Idea
Any volunteers who want to work on fully-kea devtools? It would be nice to visually
see how the logics interact with each other, see their state (including selectors) and to 
be able to call actions on them with the push of a button.

Here's a [gist](/docs/playground/gists/#kea-devtools)
of a really raw devtool that just displays all the logics and their values in boxes.

## Logic Path

If you explore your store's state in the devtools, you'll notice that every kea logic is
mounted under a path like `kea.logic.1` (or `kea.inline.1` prior to Kea 2.4).
 
Something like this:

### Setting the path manually

In order to help debugging, you may manually specify a `path` for your logic. 

```javascript
kea({
    path: ['scenes', 'dashboard', 'index']
})
```

If you use a `key` in your logic, it'll be passed as the first argument to the `path` function.

```javascript
kea({
    key: (props) => props.id,
    path: (key) => ['scenes', 'dashboard', 'index', key]
})
```

### Automatic paths with Babel

If you're using Babel to transpile your code, check out the [babel kea plugin](https://github.com/keajs/babel-plugin-kea).
It can generate a paths for you automatically.

First install the package:

```bash
# with yarn
yarn add babel-plugin-kea --dev

# with npm
npm install babel-plugin-kea --save-dev
```

Then add it to the list of plugins in `.babelrc`:

```json5
{
  "plugins": [
    "babel-plugin-kea"
  ]
}
```

Logic paths are scoped from your app's root path. If you wish to skip a few parts of the path, 
for example if your frontend lives under `frontend/src` and you don't want every kea path to start 
with `frontend.src`, specify it in the config as follows:

```json5
{
  "plugins": [
    ["babel-plugin-kea", { "path": "./frontend/src" }]
  ]
}
```

After these changes, the inline paths from above will look like this:
