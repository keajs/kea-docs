## Why test your logics in the first place?

While adding a new feature into a logic, such as **"make it possible to duplicate dashboards"** into
a fictional `dashboardsLogic.ts`, you write a clear set of actions, listeners, reducers and so forth.

However, when you read `dashboardsLogic.ts`, its code is grouped by functionality: first all actions, then all reducers.
The original intent behind each line of code is lost:

<p><img alt="Redux Devtools" src={useBaseUrl('img/guide/testing-why-1.png')} style={{ maxWidth: 866/2 }} /></p>

There is a lot of value in having a logic grouped by functionality. It ultimately makes it easy to add new features,
as you have a clear overview of what's already there.

Yet if you're not careful, it's also easy to make mistakes. You could change an action without understanding its place
in an existing feature, and break things.

That is why we write logic tests.

<p><img alt="Redux Devtools" src={useBaseUrl('img/guide/testing-why-2.png')} style={{ maxWidth: 856/2 }} /></p>

When building a feature, write the same story twice. Once in a test, grouping all new code together,
and once more in the logic, code split up by functionality.

One side checking the other. Two factor authentication for your code.

## Live-Replay testing

To test a logic, you dispatch some actions, and make sure they in turn change the right values and/or dispatch other actions.

You literally just write down what should happen in a chain of dispatched actions and matched values:

```ts
import { expectLogic } from 'kea-test-utils'

it('setting search query loads remote items', async () => {
    await expectLogic(logic, () => {
        logic.actions.setSearchQuery('event')
    })
        .toDispatchActions(['setSearchQuery', 'loadRemoteItems'])
        .toMatchValues({
            searchQuery: 'event',
            remoteItems: expect.objectContaining({
                count: 56, // old values from initial load
            }),
            remoteItemsLoading: true,
        })
        .toDispatchActions(['loadRemoteItemsSuccess'])
        .toMatchValues({
            searchQuery: 'event',
            remoteItems: expect.objectContaining({
                count: 3, // got new results
                results: expect.arrayContaining([expect.objectContaining({ name: 'event1' })]),
            }),
            remoteItemsLoading: false,
        })

    // also test the mocked api call separately
})
```

It doesn't matter if the actions you're matching have already been dispatched or if we need to wait for them.
`.toDispatchActions` can both query a recorded history of actions, and wait for new ones to arrive.

In turn, `.toMatchValues` matches values as they were after the matched action, no matter what they are now.

## Kea-Test-Utils

### Installing

- [Install and configure jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)
- Install `kea-test-utils` with either:
  - `yarn add --dev kea-test-utils`
  - `npm install --save-dev kea-test-utils`

### Reset the context before each test

Kea stores everything in a context. Call resetContext() before each test to reset Kea's brain.

```ts
/* global test, expect, beforeEach */
import { kea, resetContext } from 'kea'
import { testUtilsPlugin } from 'kea-test-utils'

beforeEach(() => {
    resetContext({
        plugins: [testUtilsPlugin, /* other plugins */]
    })
})

test('runs before and after mount events', async () => {
    // your test here
})
```

### Mount and unmount your logic

Read the docs on [Lifecycles](/docs/guide/advanced#lifecycles)
and [Mounting and Unmounting](/docs/guide/advanced#mounting-and-unmounting).
Then make sure your logic is mounted before the tests run:

```ts
let unmount: () => void
let logic: ReturnType<typeof dashboardLogic.build>

beforeEach(() => {
  logic = dashboardLogic({ id: 123 })
  unmount = logic.mount()
})
afterEach(() => {
  unmount()
})
```

### `expectLogic()`

The entrypoint to the Live-Replay logic testing. All of these options work:

```ts
// option 1
await expectLogic(logic, () => logic.actions.doSomething())
    .toDispatchActions(['doSomething'])

// option 2
await expectLogic(() => logic.actions.doSomething())
    .toDispatchActions(logic, ['doSomething'])

// option 3
logic.actions.doSomething()
await expectLogic(logic)
    .toDispatchActions(['doSomething'])

// option 4
logic.actions.doSomething()
await expectLogic()
    .toDispatchActions(logic, ['doSomething'])
```

### `.toDispatchActions()`

Match dispatched actions in order. Waits up to `3s` and requires `await` if any of the actions haven't already happened.

```ts
await expectLogic(logic, () => {
    logic.actions.setSearchQuery('hello')
})
    .toDispatchActions([ // array of actions
        // short form
        'setSearchQuery',
        // redux type
        logic.actionTypes.setSearchQuery,
        // full redux action
        logic.actionCreators.setSearchQuery('hello'),
        // custom matcher
        (action) => action.type === logic.actionTypes.setSearchQuery &&
                    action.payload.searchQuery === 'hello',
    ])
```

### `.toDispatchActionsInAnyOrder()`

Match dispatched actions in any order. Waits up to `3s` and requires `await` if any of the actions haven't already happened.

```ts
await expectLogic(logic, () => {
    logic.actions.setSearchQuery('hello')
})
    .toDispatchActionsInAnyOrder([ // array of actions
        // short form
        'setSearchQuery',
        // redux type
        logic.actionTypes.setSearchQuery,
        // full redux action
        logic.actionCreators.setSearchQuery('hello'),
        // custom matcher
        (action) => action.type === logic.actionTypes.setSearchQuery &&
                    action.payload.searchQuery === 'hello',
    ])
```

### `.toNotHaveDispatchedActions()`

Make sure none of the given actions have been dispatched. Use with `delay` or `toFinishListeners`.

```ts
await expectLogic(logic, () => {
    logic.actions.setSearchQuery('hello')
})
    .toNotHaveDispatchedActions([ // array of actions
        // short form
        'setSearchQuery',
        // redux type
        logic.actionTypes.setSearchQuery,
        // full redux action
        logic.actionCreators.setSearchQuery('hello'),
        // custom matcher
        (action) => action.type === logic.actionTypes.setSearchQuery &&
                    action.payload.searchQuery === 'hello',
    ])
```

### `.toFinishListeners()`

Wait for all listeners on a logic to finish.

```ts
await expectLogic(logic, () => logic.actions.doSomething())
    .toFinishListeners()
```

### `.toFinishAllListeners()`

Wait for all running listeners to finish.

```ts
await expectLogic().toFinishAllListeners()
```

### `.toMatchValues()`

Match the store's state as it was after a matched action

```ts
await expectLogic(logic, () => logic.actions.doSomething())
    .toDispatchActions(['doSomething'])
    .toMatchValues({
        something: 'done',
        somethingLoading: 'true'
    })
    .toMatchValues(otherLogic, {
        id: 123
    })
```

Use the `truth` helper or jest's `expect` matchers to make matching easier:

```ts
import { truth } from 'kea-test-utils'

await expectLogic(logic, () => logic.actions.loadResults())
    .toHaveDispatchedActions(['loadResultsSuccess'])
    .toMatchValues({
        results: truth(results => results.length === 42),
        selectedResult: expect.objectContaining({
            id: 33,
        })
    })
```

### `.toMount()`

Expect specific logics to be mounted

```ts
await expectLogic(logic).toMount([
    userLogic,
    otherLogic({ id: insight.id }),
])
```

### `.printActions()`

Show what actions have been printed now, and where the current pointer for value matching is.

```ts
await expectLogic(logic, () => logic.actions.setSearchQuery())
    .toMatchActions(['setSeachQuery'])
    .printActions()
    .printActions({ compact: true })
```

### `.delay()`

Wait the time in `ms`.

```ts
await expectLogic(logic, () => logic.actions.setSearchQuery())
    .wait(100)
    .printActions()
```


## Common issues

### Adapt kea-router to run in nodejs

To run kea-router in a jest test, you need to pass it a mocked history object. Otherwise and especially when using jsdom, the URL might persist between tests.

Install the `memory` package, and adapt as needed:

```ts
import { createMemoryHistory } from 'history'

beforeEach(() => {
  const history = createMemoryHistory()
  ;(history as any).pushState = history.push
  ;(history as any).replaceState = history.replace
  
  resetContext({
    plugins: [
      testUtilsPlugin, 
      routerPlugin({ history: history, location: history.location }),
      /* other plugins */  
    ]
  })
})
```

### How to test Kea and React together

If you keep all your state in Kea, and only test your logics, you're mostly done with your frontend testing.

What's missing is making sure the right values are rendered in the right places, and the right actions get clicked
when the right button is pressed.

I'm not yet ready to recommend a best practice here. However a year ago
[this approach](https://github.com/keajs/kea/blob/master/test/jest/hooks.js) got the job done.
