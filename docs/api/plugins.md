:::note Tip
Read the [writing plugins](/docs/guide/writing-plugins) guide to learn more about plugins.

Here are all the options you can use within a plugin:

```javascript
const myPlugin = () => ({
  // Required: name of the plugin
  name: '',

  // default values for output in logic stores, also used to register keys that logic will contain
  defaults: () => ({
    key: {}
  }),

  // when are the build steps run (skip this and they are appended to the end)
  buildOrder: {
    listeners: { before: 'events' },
    thunks: { after: 'actionCreators' }
  },

  // either add new steps or add after effects for existing steps
  buildSteps: {
    // steps from core that you can extend
    connect (logic, input) {},
    constants (logic, input) {},
    actions (logic, input) {},
    defaults (logic, input) {},
    reducers (logic, input) {},
    reducer (logic, input) {},
    reducerSelectors (logic, input) {},
    selectors (logic, input) {},
    // or add your own steps with custom names here and other plugins can then extend them
  },

  events: {
    // Run after creating a new context, before plugins are activated and the store is created
    afterOpenContext (context, options) {},
    // Run after this plugin has been activated
    afterPlugin () {},
    // Run before the redux store creation begins. Use it to add options (middleware, etc) to the store creator.
    beforeReduxStore (options) {},
    // Run after the redux store is created.
    afterReduxStore (options, store) {},
    // Run before we start doing anything
    beforeKea (input) {},
    // before the steps to build the logic (gets an array of inputs from kea(input).extend(input))
    beforeBuild (logic, inputs) {},
    // before the steps to convert input into logic (also run once per .extend())
    beforeLogic (logic, input) {},
    // after the steps to convert input into logic (also run once per .extend())
    afterLogic (logic, input) {},
    // after the steps to build the logic
    afterBuild (logic, inputs) {},
    // Run before/after a logic store is mounted in React
    beforeMount (logic) {},
    afterMount (logic) {},
    // Run before/after a reducer is attached to Redux
    beforeAttach (logic) {},
    afterAttach (logic) {},
    // Run before/after a logic store is unmounted in React
    beforeUnmount (logic) {},
    afterUnmount (logic) {},
    // Run before/after a reducer is detached frm Redux
    beforeDetach (logic) {},
    afterDetach (logic) {},
    // when wrapping a React component
    beforeWrapper (input, Klass) {},
    afterWrapper (input, Klass, Kea) {},
    // Run after mounting and before rendering the component in React's scope (you can use hooks here)
    beforeRender (logic, props) {},
    // Run when we are removing kea from the system, e.g. when cleaning up after tests
    beforeCloseContext (context) {}
  }
})
