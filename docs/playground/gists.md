import Gist from './gists/gist'

Here are some funny and/or interesting gists that showcase random things you can do with Kea.

They are very rough pieces of code and should be turned into real projects. Any volunteers?

I don't have time for everything, sorry :).


## Kea GraphQL

An early draft of a GraphQL client. I built it as an experiment, but left the project 
before I could turn it into a real plugin.

<Gist username="mariusandra" id="26f2c550026a3bee98a107447e0fb99f" />

## Kea Dimensions

A fun plugin to store the window dimensions inside a reducer and keep them up to date.

<Gist username="mariusandra" id="ed989e0a362cb9beb30526abf85b1021" />

## Kea DevTools

A very raw version of devtools. It just shows all mounted logic and their actions and values.
It needs support for 1) calling actions, 2) showing data in a meaningful way,
3) showing the connections between logic as a map, 4) showing the relationship between
logic and react components

## More Gists Welcome!

Built something fun, cool or noteworthy, yet not enough commitment to support a plugin?
