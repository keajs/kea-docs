Here are various CodeSandboxes you can play around in:

- [Empty Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/kea-starter-8msre?file=/src/app.js) - fork this
  to start a new project!

- [Three button counter](https://codesandbox.io/s/kea-three-buttons-fbfv6?file=/src/app.js) - with
  two ways to do the logic. Can you guess what's the difference?

Feel free to add cool demos! [Edit the page](https://github.com/keajs/kea-docs/edit/master/docs/playground/sandboxes.md) and send a PR!
