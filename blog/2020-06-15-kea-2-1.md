Kea 2.1 does two things:
- Continues the "let's make things simpler" trend started in [Kea 2.0](/blog/kea-2.0)
  by removing another bunch of squiggly bits that you will not need to type again:
  `"        ((((((()))))))===>>>{}"`
- Adds support for accessing the state *before* an action was fired inside listeners.

It's also backwards compatible: Logic written for Kea version 1.0 will still run in 2.1.

## The saga until now:

This is Kea 1.0:

```javascript
const logic = kea({
    actions: () => ({
        goUp: true,
        goDown: true,
        setFloor: floor => ({ floor })
    }),
    reducers: ({ actions }) => ({
        floor: [1, {
            [actions.goUp]: state => state + 1,
            [actions.goDown]: state => state - 1,
            [actions.setFloor]: (_, { floor }) => floor
        }]
    }),
    selectors: ({ selectors }) => ({
        systemState: [
            () => [selectors.floor],
            floor => floor < 1 || floor > 20 ? 'broken' : 'working'
        ]
    }),
    listeners: ({ actions, values }) => ({
        [actions.setFloor]: ({ floor }) => {
            console.log('set floor to:', floor)
            
            if (values.systemState === 'broken') {
                console.log('you broke the system!')
            }
        }
    })
})
```

In Kea 2.0 we can skip `[actions.]` and `{ actions }`: 

```javascript
const logic = kea({
    actions: () => ({
        goUp: true,
        goDown: true,
        setFloor: floor => ({ floor })
    }),
    reducers: () => ({  // removed "{ actions }"
        floor: [1, {
            goUp: state => state + 1,  // removed "[actions.]"
            goDown: state => state - 1,  // removed "[actions.]"
            setFloor: (_, { floor }) => floor  // removed "[actions.]"
        }]
    }),
    selectors: ({ selectors }) => ({
        systemState: [
            () => [selectors.floor],
            floor => floor < 1 || floor > 20 ? 'broken' : 'working'
        ]
    }),
    listeners: ({ values }) => ({
        setFloor: ({ floor }) => { // changed
            console.log('set floor to:', floor)
            
            if (values.systemState === 'broken') {
                console.log('you broke the system!')
            }
        }
    })
})
```

You can still write `[actions.]` explicitly... and you do it mostly when
using actions from another logic: 

```javascript
import { janitorLogic } from './janitorLogic'
 
const elevatorLogic = kea({
    reducers: ({ actions }) => ({
        floor: [1, {
            goUp: state => state + 1,  // local action
            [actions.goDown]: state => state - 1,  // no longer useful
            [janitorLogic.actions.setFloor]: (_, { floor }) => floor
        }]
    }),
})
```

... but you save 41 keystrokes in the default case:

```javascript
"{ actions }[actions.][actions.][actions.]"  // byebye
```


## Changed in Kea 2.1:

Why stop there?

There's another low hanging fruit we can eliminate: `() => ({})`.

Gone! 

```javascript
const logic = kea({
    actions: {  // removed "() => ("
        goUp: true,
        goDown: true,
        setFloor: floor => ({ floor })
    },  // removed ")"
    reducers: {  // removed "() => ("
        floor: [1, {
            goUp: state => state + 1,
            goDown: state => state - 1,
            setFloor: (_, { floor }) => floor
        }]
    },  // removed ")"
    selectors: ({ selectors }) => ({
        systemState: [
            () => [selectors.floor],
            floor => floor < 1 || floor > 20 ? 'broken' : 'working'
        ]
    }),
    listeners: ({ values }) => ({
        setFloor: ({ floor }) => {
            console.log('set floor to:', floor)
            
            if (values.systemState === 'broken') {
                console.log('you broke the system!')
            }
        }
    })
})
```

16 units of squiggly bits gone! Here they are, in chronological **and** ascending order:

```javascript
"() => ()() => ()" // chronological
"    (((())))==>>" // ascending
```

They are there if you need them, of course. For example when using
`props` in `reducers`:

```javascript
kea({
    reducers: ({ props }) => ({
        floor: [props.defaultFloor, {
            goUp: state => state + 1,
            goDown: state => state - 1,
        }]
    }),
})
```

What about the selectors? How can we simplify this?

```javascript
kea({
    selectors: ({ selectors }) => ({
        systemState: [
            () => [selectors.floor],
            floor => floor < 1 || floor > 20 ? 'broken' : 'working'
        ]
    })
})
```

Here's the simplest backwards-compatible change that went into Kea 2.1:

```javascript
kea({
    selectors: {  // spot
        systemState: [
            selectors => [selectors.floor],  // the
            floor => floor < 1 || floor > 20 ? 'broken' : 'working'
        ]
    } // difference
})
```

Goodbye another 14 spaces and squgglies:

```javascript
"({  }) => ()()"
``` 

If you're *really* feeling the minimalist vibe, you could also simplify
the object in `listeners` and `events`, but:

```javascript
const elevatorLogic = kea({
    listeners: {
        setFloor: ({ floor }) => {
            console.log('set floor to:', floor)
 
            if (elevatorLogic.values.systemState === 'broken') {
                console.log('you broke the system!')
            }
        }
    }
})
```

You might get tired of writing `thisLogic` everywhere. 

In general, the suggestion is to always write the simplest thing first: 

```javascript
kea({
    reducers: {
        poteito: // ...
    }
})
```

... and only when needed, extend it into a function to pull in objects and evaluate
lazily:

```javascript
kea({
    reducers: ({ props }) => ({
        potaato: // ...
    })
})
```

## Previous State in Listeners

There's a certain way listeners work:

```javascript
kea({
    actions: {
        setFloor: floor => ({ floor })
    },
    reducers: {
        floor: {
            setFloor: (_, { floor }) => floor
        }
    },
    listeners: ({ values }) => ({
        setFloor: ({ floor }, breakpoint, action) => {
            // { floor } = payload of the action          
            // breakpoint = some cool stuff ;)
            // action = the full redux action, in case you need it

            console.log("floor in action payload: ", floor)
            console.log("floor in state: ", values.floor)

            if (floor === values.floor) {  // this is true
                console.log('the reducer already ran')
                console.log('before the listener started')
            }
        }
    }),
)
```

The `action` will first update the `reducers` and only then run the `listener`.

What if you really need the state before the action ran?

You could set up a two step system (`setFloorStart` & `setFloorUpdate`)
... or you could use `previousState`, the new 4th argument to listeners:

```javascript
kea({
    actions: {
        setFloor: floor => ({ floor })
    },
    reducers: {
        floor: {
            setFloor: (_, { floor }) => floor
        }
    },
    listeners: ({ selectors, values }) => ({
        setFloor: ({ floor }, _, __, previousState) => {
            // { floor } = payload          
            // _ = breakpoint
            // __ = action
            // previousState = the state of the store before the action

            const lastFloor = selectors.floor(previousState)
   
            if (floor < lastFloor) {
                console.log('going down!')
            }
            if (floor > lastFloor) {
                console.log('going up!')
            }
        }
    }),
)
```

Take the store's `previousState` (new 4th argument) and run it through any 
`selector` you can get your hands on. Every `value` has a `selector`, so you 
have plenty to choose from.

:::note How does this work?
This is just another benefit of using Redux under the hood. More specifically,
using the idea redux popularised: store everything in one large tree and
propagate changes in its branches through cascading immutable updates.

Every unique version of the entire state tree ends up in a plain JS `object`.
This state object is only read from and it will never change... and it's discarded
as soon as the next `state` comes in.

We can still keep a reference to this previous state and use selectors
on it to get whichever selected or computed value we need.

Easy as pie!

Mmm... pie. :cake:

:::note 4th argument?
Yeah, it's getting busy up there, but :shrug:. I'm not going to make a breaking
change for this.
