:::note
New to Kea or saw it last a few years ago? You should [take a closer look](/). 
A lot has changed and you might like what you see! 😃
:::

8 months after the release of Kea 1.0 I'm proud to announce version 2.0!

This version brings several *convenience features*. It's a rather small release, yet there
were a few breaking changes, which warranted a new major version.

What changed? Read below! 

But first! You are reading this blog post in the [**brand new documentation**](/) for Kea! Powered by [docusaurus v2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/)!
Over *17000 new words* were written for these docs in an effort to really clarify
how Kea works. 

Start with [What is Kea?](/docs/introduction/what-is-kea) if you're new here. Then head on to the [core concepts](/docs/guide/concepts). 
Please also read them if you've been using Kea for a while. You might learn something you didn't know!
Then check out [additional concepts](/docs/guide/additional), [debugging](/docs/guide/debugging) and other pages for more. 

Anyway, where were we?
 
Oh yes, new stuff in Kea 2.0! 🤩


## Listeners built in (1 Breaking Change)

For years Kea has supported two different side effect libraries: [sagas](/docs/plugins/sagas) and 
[thunks](/docs/plugins/thunks).

With Kea 1.0, I added a new lightweight one called [listeners](/docs/guide/concepts#listeners).

Listeners solve the main issue with thunks (you can't use thunks in reducers) and let you
write much simpler code than sagas, while retaining the most commonly used features of sagas
(debouncing and cancelling workers a'la `takeLatest`).
Unless you're writing highly interactive applications, you will probably not need to use sagas anymore.

Before 2.0 `listeners` was an optional plugin, but now it's included by default. 
This enables two big things:

* Much easier to get started with Kea
* Plugin authors have a side-effect library that they can always rely on instead of writing
  bindings for 3 different systems.

Weighing at just [1.4KB](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=kea-listeners@0.2.3) (gzipped, 3.4KG minified),
including listeners in kea doesn't add a lot of weight.

Yet if you wish to disable them, use `skipPlugins` when upgrading:
 
```javascript
resetContext({ skipPlugins: ['listeners'] })
```

**Breaking change, please note:** If you were using listeners with Kea 1.0, make sure to remove `listenersPlugin` from 
your `resetContext({ plugins: [] })` array or Kea will complain that it's being imported twice.

## Writing `[actions.` and `]` is now optional

This used to be the only way to write reducers and listeners:

```javascript
// Works in all versions of Kea
const logic = kea({
    actions: () => ({
        increment: (amount) => ({ amount }),
        setCounter: (counter) => ({ counter }),
        reset: true
    }),
    reducers: ({ actions }) => ({
        counter: [0, { 
            [actions.increment]: (state, { amount }) => state + amount,
            [actions.setCounter]: (_, { counter }) => counter,
            [actions.reset]: () => 0
        }]
    }),
    listeners: ({ actions }) => ({
        [actions.reset]: () => {
            console.log('reset called')
        }
    })
})
```

Now you can do this:

```javascript
// Works with Kea 2.0+
const logic = kea({
    actions: () => ({
        increment: (amount) => ({ amount }),
        setCounter: (counter) => ({ counter }),
        reset: true
    }),
    reducers: () => ({
        counter: [0, { 
            increment: (state, { amount }) => state + amount,
            setCounter: (_, { counter }) => counter,
            reset: () => 0
        }]
    }),
    listeners: () => ({
        reset: () => {  
            console.log('reset called')
        }
    })
})
```

If your actions are defined in the same logic (or imported with `connect`), you can
skip writing `[actions.  ]` and also skip `({ actions })`.

Writing `[actions.increment]` will still work, just like writing `[otherLogic.actions.actionName]`.

This will be especially nice for TypeScript users, who [were forced](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/14207) 
to write `[actions.increment as any]` to avoid constantly bumping into *"error TS2464: 
A computed property name must be of type 'string', 'number', 'symbol', or 'any'"*. 

## Auto-Connect!

Up to Kea 1.0, when you used actions or values from `otherLogic` inside your `logic`,
you had to `connect` them together. 

```javascript
import { counterLogic } from './counterLogic'

// Works in all versions of Kea
const logic = kea({
    connect: {
        // pulling in actions from `counterLogic`
        actions: [counterLogic, ['increment', 'decrement']],
        // pull in values from `counterLogic`
        values: [counterLogic, ['counter']],
    },

    listeners: ({ actions, values }) => ({
        [actions.increment]: () => {
            console.log('Increment called!')
            console.log(`Counter: ${values.counter}`)
        }
    })
})
```

Now you can skip `connect` (if you want to) and call all actions and values directly
on `counterLogic`:

```javascript
import { counterLogic } from './counterLogic'

// Works in Kea 2.0+
const logic = kea({
    listeners: () => ({
        [counterLogic.actions.increment]: () => {
            console.log('Increment called!')
            console.log(`Counter: ${counterLogic.values.counter}`)
        }
    })
})
```

While this *also* works in Kea 1.0 under *some* conditions, the code above will always work with
Kea 2.0.

In version 1.0 you had to manually assure that `counterLogic` was mounted before calling `actions`
and `values` on it. Perhaps it was mounted via `useValues` in React or alternatively
you could also write: `connect: { logic: [counterLogic] }` without specifying what exactly to
connect. The code above would then also work.

In version 2.0 this is no longer necessary. When you:
* use `counterLogic.actions.increment` as a *key* in `reducers` or `listeners` 
* use `counterLogic.selectors.counter` in `selectors`
* use `counterLogic.anything.really` *inside* a `listener`

... then `counterLogic` is automatically connected to `logic` and mounted/unmounted when needed.

This means the following code will also work:

```javascript
import { counterLogic } from './counterLogic'

// Works in Kea 2.0+
const logic = kea({
    actions: () => ({
        showCount: true
    }),
    listeners: () => ({
        showCount: () => {
            console.log('Increment called!')
            console.log(`Counter: ${counterLogic.values.counter}`)
        }
    })
})
```

In this example, the *first* time you use `counterLogic` is inside a listener when getting
a `value` from it.

If `counterLogic` was not already mounted, it will be mounted directly when you call `showCount`.
It will stay mounted for as long as `logic` is still mounted. 
It will be unmounted together with `logic` in case no other mounted logic or component has a lock on it.

There is one caveat with `autoConnect` for when you want to manually call `mount()` and `unmount()`
inside a listener. For that please read the section in the [Using without React](/docs/guide/advanced#calling-mount-inside-listeners-with-autoconnect-true) 
page.

To opt out of autoConnect, pass `autoConnect: false` to `resetContext`.

## (Optional) Babel plugin to autogenerate paths

If you have ever used the [redux devtools](/docs/guide/debugging), to debug your logic, 
you will have noticed that unless you specify a `path` in your logic, it will be automatically
placed under `kea.inline.[N]` like so:

<img alt="Redux Devtools with Inline Paths" src={useBaseUrl('img/guide/redux-devtools-inline.png')} style={{ maxWidth: 633 }} />
<br/><br/>

With the new [babel-plugin-kea](https://github.com/keajs/babel-plugin-kea), these paths can be
autogenerated from the filesystem, greatly enhancing your debugging experience:  

<img alt="Redux Devtools with Autogenerated Paths" src={useBaseUrl('img/guide/redux-devtools-auto.png')} style={{ maxWidth: 633 }} />
<br/><br/>

What's more, this can be used in combination with plugins like 
[kea-localstorage](/docs/plugins/localstorage) or in frameworks like [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to 
persist values or hydrate server-rendered logic easier than ever before.


## Other smaller improvements

Those were the big ones. A few other things made it into Kea 2.0.

### You can extend reducers

Previously in this case:

```javascript
// Works with Kea 1.0
const logic = kea({
    actions: () => ({
        doSomething: true,
        doSomethingMore: true,
    }),
    reducers: ({ actions }) => ({
        myValue: [0, {
            [actions.doSomething]: () => 100
        }]
    })
}) 
logic.extend({
    reducers: ({ actions }) => ({
        myValue: [0, {
            [actions.doSomethingMore]: () => 10000
        }]
    })
}) 
```

The entire reducer for `myValue` would be overridden. This means only the action 
`doSomethingMore` would have any effect on the value. This is no longer the case and the reducer
mapping is merged when a reducer is extended.

In case of conflicts, later actions override previously defined ones. However the first default
value is taken. To override a default, just specify it separately with `defaults: { myValue: 100 }`
within `kea({})`

### In `resetContext`, `createStore` is now `true` by default

Previously when using `resetContext` and not using any other redux-specific middleware or libraries,
you had to write:

```javascript
// Works with all versions of Kea, but not needed in 2.0
resetContext({
    createStore: true // or {}
})
```

Omitting this `createStore: true` line would cause Kea to fail. This is no longer necessary.
The redux store will be created when you call `resetContext` without any arguments. 
Pass `false` to `createStore` if you wish to avoid this.

### The `path` in your logic can start with anything

Previously you had to write:

```javascript
// Works with all versions of Kea, but not needed in 2.0
resetContext({
    createStore: {
        // defaulted to ['kea', 'scenes']
        paths: ['kea', 'scenes', 'pages', 'components']
    }
})
```

... if you wanted your `logic.path` to start with `pages` or anything other than `kea` or `scenes`.
The first part of the path had to be whitelisted.

This is no longer necessary. If you omit `paths` in `createStore`, you can use whatever string
for the first part of your logic's path.

Specifying `paths` reverts to whitelisting and anything else is disallowed.
Only now it will also throw an error instead of silently just not connecting the logic to redux.
 
### Create a reducer without a default

This used to be the only way to define reducers:

```javascript
const counterLogic = kea({
    actions: () => ({
        increment: true,
        decrement: true,
    }),

    reducers: ({ actions }) => ({
        counter: [0, { // `0` as default
            [actions.increment]: (state) => state + 1,
            [actions.decrement]: (state) => state - 1
        }]
    })
})
```

Now if you prefer, you can omit the default value in `reducers`:

```javascript
const counterLogic = kea({
    actions: () => ({
        increment: true,
        decrement: true,
    }),

    reducers: () => ({
        counter: { // `null` as default if not given in `defaults`
            increment: (state) => (state || 0) + 1,
            decrement: (state) => (state || 0) - 1
        }
    })
})
```

... and either define it in `defaults` or not at all. It'll just be `null` if not defined.

### Action type string no longer skips `scenes.`

This is a very minor tweak.

Previously if your action had a `path` that started with `scenes`, then it was skipped in the
action type `toString()`.

```javascript
// before
homepageLogic.path == ['scenes', 'homepage', 'index']
homepageLogic.action.reloadPage.toString() === 'reload page (homepage.index)'

accountLogic.path == ['menu', 'account', 'index']
accountLogic.action.reloadAccount.toString() === 'reload account (menu.account.index)'
```

Now it's included:

```javascript
// after
homepageLogic.path == ['scenes', 'homepage', 'index']
homepageLogic.action.reloadPage.toString() === 'reload page (scenes.homepage.index)'

accountLogic.path == ['menu', 'account', 'index']
accountLogic.action.reloadAccount.toString() === 'reload account (menu.account.index)'
```

I told you this was a very minor tweak!

## What's next? (Kea 2.1 and/or 3.0)

There are two main things I'd like to explore in the next versions of Kea.

### TypeScript support

One of the [most](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/d386wp/kea_10_released_data_layer_for_react_powered_by/f00ddmv/)
[requested](https://github.com/keajs/kea/issues/65) features for Kea has been proper TypeScript support. 
While you can get pretty far with Kea in TS if you [manually create your interfaces](https://github.com/keajs/kea/issues/35#issuecomment-561814506),
this is sub-optimal.

The goal for Kea 2.1 (or 3.0?) is to have full and automatic TypeScript support. In fact,
many of the changes with 2.0 (namely eliminating the need for `connect` & no need to write `[actions.__]`) 
were done to pave the way.

Even if you don't use TypeScript, this will help IDEs offer proper autocomplete support when writing
Kea in regular JavaScript.  

### Precomplication

At the end of the day, Kea is just an engine that converts `input` into `logic` plus a framework
to mount/unmount this `logic` when requested by React components.

What if we could do some of this conversion at *compile-time*, rather than at runtime?

Now that we have a [babel plugin](/docs/guide/debugging#automatic-paths-with-babel) that automatically 
adds paths to logic, could this be extended to speed up runtime Kea by inlining some of these 
conversions where possible? Would it make a difference in runtime speed?

Kea's performance has never been an issue so far, but this is an interesting avenue for some exploration.

To be continued.
