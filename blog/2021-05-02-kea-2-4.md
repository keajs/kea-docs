What's that? A new release?!?

Kea 2.4 brings the following:

- Fixed crashes with [React Fast Refresh](https://github.com/keajs/kea/issues/119).

- Changed the [default path](https://keajs.org/docs/guide/debugging#logic-path) for logic 
  without a `path` (or when not using the kea babel plugin) from `kea.inline.2` to `kea.logic.2`. If you have ever hardcoded 
  `"kea.inline"` anywhere, perhaps in tests, this will cause a bit of headache. If you need it set at `kea.inline`, use:
  `resetContext({ defaultPath: ['kea', 'inline'] })`.

- Added `<Provider />` tag to simplify calling React-Redux's `<Provider store={getContext().store} />`.
  
Oh, and there's a [new Kea CRA template](https://keajs.org/docs/installation/instructions#shortcut-cra-template) you can use.

Starting a new CRA project with all the Kea tools configured is now as simple as running:

```shell
yarn create react-app my-kea-app --template kea-typescript
cd my-kea-app
yarn start
```

... and you're good to go!
